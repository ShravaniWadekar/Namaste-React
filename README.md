# Namaste-React
Currently I am learning React.js and this is the project I am currently working on while learning the React.js
This project is a simple restaurant listing application built using React.js. It features a user interface displaying restaurant information such as name, cuisine, rating, delivery time, and more. The project is currently using mock data to render restaurant cards that include key details about various restaurants.
